# AirbnbBerlin
Analytics with Airbnb Data from June 2024

This was a personal project where I analyzed public airbnb listing data for Berlin.
I conducted some descriptive statistical tests in python jupyter notebooks.
I also did some geojson mapping with listing data. 

Finally, I created a tableau presentation to summarize my findings.
